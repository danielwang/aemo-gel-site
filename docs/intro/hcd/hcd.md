It's our centralised and single source of truth to our digital Human-Centred Design (HCD), also referred to as Design-Thinking is the mindset and apporach that overlay across User Experience (UX), Customer Experience (CX), Service Design (SD) and User Interface (UI). The HCD mindset ensures that the services, products and tools that we create are actually relevant and beneficial to the people they are intended to serve.

This area will house our HCD Framework and other key guidelines and principles.
 
# What exactly is HCD?

Human-Centred Design, also referred to as Design Thinking is an approach to problem-solving that focuses on and places the needs of people at it's core. At it's core, it is mindset concerned with ensuring that the services, products and tools that we create are actually relevant, and beneficial to the people they are intended to serve.

It all starts with building empathy with the people we are designing for (the actual usersof our solutions) to understand their needs, pain-points, behaviours and goals.

In clearly understanding and defining these early, we limit the assumptions we are making, and mitigate the risk of designing the wrong thing, the wrong way - wasting time and money in the process.



# Who do we design for?
At AEMO these people are all of us, including our staff, our participants, stakeholders as well as end consumers. It includes every one who plays a part of the system that we are designing.

 

# Why Human-Centred Design?
A Human-Centred Design approach drives engagement in our sevices and increases efficiencies. Ensuring we build tools and services with the right features to match our customer needs and solve pain-points.
