>With 1 in 5 Australians having a disability, we have an obligation to ensure that our tools and services are accessible

# What does Accessibility mean?
Accessibility refers to allowing all people equal access and equal opportunity, regardless of their abilities to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with us and our services.

# Planning for accessibility
We are working towards meeting the WCAG Guidelines for all our solutions, but creating an accessible website means more than just meeting a guideline or ticking off a checklist. It's about empathising with all our users and it shouldn't be an afterthought. If we can ensure our solutions are accessible, we improve the experience for all.

# What are the types of disabilities?
## Mobility and physical impairments

Disability in mobility can include temporary and permanent injuries as well as diseeases and congential conditions. These affect the body across the upper limbs, lower limbs and manual dexterity.

## Vision

There are hundreds of thousands of people with varying degrees of vision impairment. These include blindness, low vision and colour blindness

## Hearing

1 in 6 Australians are affected by hearing loss. Hearing disabilities include hard of hearing through to complete deafness. 

## Cognitive

These include learning disabilities, distractibility and inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information



# Considerations to make when designing solutions
## Design

Provide meaningful text alternatives for important imagery
Ensure colour contrast meets requirements
Avoid using colour alone to convey meaning
Allow users to skip over navigation menus
Use icons and other visual aids to assist 

## Content

Avoid using complex language and jargon where possible
Ensure links are understood
