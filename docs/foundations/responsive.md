# What is Responsive Design?
Responsive design ensures the design and content of web-based tools and websites will scale to the size of the device that is being used. In most cases, functionality should match across all devices so that users are able to perform the same actions regardless of where and when they are attempting to.

Best practice is to start with a mobile-first approach, ensuring all relevant content and functionality is available on smaller devices with the design scaling up and responding to larger devices - as opposed to the opposite of designing for desktop first and attempting to ensure content and functionality works on mobile.
