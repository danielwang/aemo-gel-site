>A library of pictograph has been curated for AEMO. 


The suite of pictograph has been carefully created to sit cohesively alongside other brand elements and forms the basis of many of the brandâ€™s graphic illustrations and elements. Pictograph can be used to represent abstract concepts or physical objects. Paired with type, pictograph can help tell many different stories and add visual interest to reports, documents and presentations.
