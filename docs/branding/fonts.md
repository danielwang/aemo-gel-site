>Typography is an essential part of the AEMO visual system. When used consistently, it unifies messaging and creates familiarity.

Good typography not only differentiates a brand but also communicates the brandâ€™s style, personality and tone of voice. It has a huge influence on brand perception and recognition. 
     
Our default typeface has been chosen to maximise legibility across a number of font sizes and to ensure we have clear, consistent headings, paragraphs and form elements.

### Avenir typeface
A well known, versatile, and professional typeface that has been used in a varying number of weights to create a sense of control and contrast.

Avenir is the primary font. AEMO communications should use Avenir, including all body copy and headings.

The typeface is made up of multiple weights: Light, Book, Medium, Heavy, and Black. Italicised versions are also included in the family.

The default weight to use is Avenir Light for body copy and Avenir Heavy or Black for headings.

The supporting weights of Avenir may also be used, but usually for emphasis in smaller applications such as captions, tables, charts, and diagrams.

Title and sentence case are preferred. Only use all caps in small instances such as charts, labels, and UI navigation. Avoid adding outlines, drop shadows or other effects to type
