## Product Design 

### Design the "right" thing

The main goal of UX design research is to inform the design process from the perspective of the end user. Explore customer problems to solve and opportunities to add value to our users.

 - Human-Centred Design, [Design Thinking process](https://www.figma.com/file/thlFIi4nMTEh7LmYLNPWGC/DesignOps?node-id=46%3A125&t=RqKOuZu9QdID4muS-1)
    - Empathise: Understand the needs, wants and pain points of the users by conducting research, user interviews, and observing users in their natural environment
    - Define: Clearly define the problem statement and user needs by synthesising insights from research.
    - Ideate: Generate a wide variety of ideas and solutions to the problem, encourage divergent thinking and collaboration
 - [Empathy Map](https://www.figma.com/file/thlFIi4nMTEh7LmYLNPWGC/DesignOps?node-id=204%3A1654&t=RqKOuZu9QdID4muS-1)

### Design the thing right
Use common tools to ensure individual projects across the organisation deliver on brand and connected customer experiences optimised for the digital channel

- Prototype: Create wireframe, mockup or workable prototype to help test and validate the ideated solution
- Test: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the solution, and use this feedback to iterate and improve upon the solution.
- Implement: Implement the validated solution created


## Design foundations

By having a solid understanding of the design foundations at AEMO, you can approach your work, allowing you to make well-informed decisions at every stage of the design and decision-making process.

<Foundations>
    <Foundation name="design principles" />
    <Foundation name="colours" />
    <Foundation name="typography" />
    <Foundation name="icons" />
    <Foundation name="responsive" />
    <Foundation name="accessibility" />
</Foundations>


## Start designing

The prototyping phase of the design process is time consuming. Bring your ideas and low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes faster with ready to use app templates and a library of components you can customize.

<Foundations>
    <Foundation name="design tokens" />
    <Foundation name="library" />
    <Foundation name="figma" />
    <Foundation name="writing guideline" />
</Foundations>


## Tools
