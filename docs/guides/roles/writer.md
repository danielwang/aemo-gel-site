## How GEL enables tech writers

* **Flexibility:** Tech writers provide the basis to adapt the content to different context and needs of the user. Tech writers can create content that are flexible enough to be used in variety of products and platforms.
* **Continuous improvement:** Tech writers can use the design system to gather feedback from users and other stakeholders and use the feedbacks to improve documentation and content.
* **Brand consistency:** Tech writers dictate the standard of tone and voice that is used alignment with the brand and the company's overall messagin. With this inclusion, other consumers of GEL including UX designer, BA, and developers get a better idea of what tone of voice, language, and styles are to be used in the product.
* **Collaboration and communication:** GEL stays as a middle ground between tech writers, UX designers, developers, BAs and product managers. By providing a common language and framework for product developement, GL ensures that all team are on the same page and work towards the same goal reducing misunderstandings and errors in documentation and content.
