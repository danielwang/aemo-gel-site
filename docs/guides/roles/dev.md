> As a software developer, it's important to have a clear understanding of the design system and how to implement it in your code. Working closely with the designers and the design system allows you to know about the patterns available and make informed decisions in the development process.


## UI Design

Hi-fidelity UI mockups should be provided by UX designer. A solid understaing of the design foundation at AEMO allows you to make well-informed decisions at every stage of the development process.

<Foundations>
    <Foundation name="responsive" />
    <Foundation name="accessibility" />
    <Foundation name="colours" />
    <Foundation name="typography" />
    <Foundation name="icons" />
</Foundations>


## UI Development

AEMO project comes with inbuilt design tokens that enables you to create the UI faster. The following will enable you to scan through the tokens that are available. In addition, you can also understand the functionality of each component under different circumstances.
