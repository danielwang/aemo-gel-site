## Documentation Strategy

The purpose of documentation strategy is to help participants and public about AEMO’s participant-facing IT systems on AEMO’s website. This process ensure a single source of truth is retained. Additionally this also reduces support calls and documentation costs and prevents duplication of work and copy/paste errors.


## Grammar and Writing Style

* Plain English: Active voice/present tense, clear, concise, and correct. Indications of passive voice are: be, being, by. For example: The priceless vase was stolen by John. To rewrite in active voice: John stole the priceless vase.
* Avoid the subjective tense whenever possible (that).  For example, I insist  that  he leave(s) now. If the sentence makes sense without that, then leave it out. 
* We do use the serial comma when the sentence is a list, e.g. you can have this, that, or another.
* Users: Please avoid this word. We prefer participants or participant users.
* Glossary terms are capitalised and included in the glossary.
* Rules terms are included in the Rules Terms section (not italicised in the document).


## UI Text Guidelines

While there are many different topics covered under tech writer, the following topics can be helpful for UI designers. This includes guidelines for headings and titles, numbers, and spellings to ensure consistency. Following these guidelines helps create a polished and UI standard to AEMO's writing standard.

### Headings and titles

When writing copy in any UI design, the following pattern to write the title and paragraph text must be followed.
* Title: Title Case
* h1: Title Case
* h2 and below: Sentence case

### Numbers

The numbers '0' and '1' are difficult for some users to read. Some typefaces make it difficult to see the difference between:
* the letter 'O' and numberical '0'
* the letters 'I' (capital 'i'), 'l'  (lowercase 'L') and number '1'
* The numerical '1' also sometimes is confused with the number '7'

In order to ignore this problem from existing in the first place, writing 'zero' and 'one' helps ensure all users understand that a number is being referred.

:::info Example

Only **one** person agreed to it.

Their aim is **zero** net emissions by 2050.

They were open to discussin **3** options.
:::

### Spelling

First reference in the [Macquarie dictionary](http://macquariedictionary.com.au/login).
