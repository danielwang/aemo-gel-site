## Variants

There are several types of Buttons with varying degree of emphasis. Emphasis determines a Button's appearance and placement.

|             | Default | Hover/Focus | Disabled | Selected |
| --          | ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| Primary     |  |  |
| Secondary   | 
| Danger      |
| Link button |

## Usage

| Type         | Emphasis | When to use | 
| --          | ------- | ----------- | 
| Primary     | High | Use to draw attention to the primary action on a screen. There should be only one Primary Button on a page at a time. Not all screens require a Primary Button. |
| Secondary   | Medium | Use for secondary actions on a screen. Secondary Buttons can be used on most pages without constrictions.  |
| Danger      | High | Use to let users know they have an option to delete or remove data. They commonly appear in confirmation dialogs as the final confirmation before deleting. |
| Link button | Low | Use for actions that are less crucial. Tertiary Buttons are not links. They have focus states and are designed with a container. Always have a label that clearly communicates what action will occur if a user clicks or taps the button. |
