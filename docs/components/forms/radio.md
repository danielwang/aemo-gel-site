## Guidance

* Similar to checkboxes, radio buttons ideally should be stacked vertically, however can be horizontally placed if the width is sufficient.
* All radio should be followed by text in a from.
* One radio button should be selected by default using the checked attribute.
* Users are able to select an option by clicking/tapping either the radio button or its label.
* Consider using a single Select if the options provided are more than 5.

## When to use

* Use radio buttons to present a set of options, where only one option can be selected at a time.
