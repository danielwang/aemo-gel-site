## Demo

## Guidance

* The selected time and date should be reflected in the input box for both date and time picker components.
* The time and calendar are displayed as dropdown upon clicking the icon in the selection area. User can type if they click in the input area instead of the icon.
* The placeholder indicates the behaviour in which the selected value will be displayed to the user.
* The icon in the date and time picker differentiates it from a regular text input even though the functionality are similar.

## When to use

* Use the date and time picker if the user wants to populate the given input field with either Date or Time.
