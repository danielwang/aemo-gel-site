* User progress bar to indicate the percentage of completion of a process.
* Similar to spinner, in ideal scenario, there would be only one Progress bar at a time in a frame/screen.
* The progress bar component should be supported by visible text indicating what the bar is for, and the units of progress represented.


## When to use

* Scenarios to let user inform percentage of completion of a  process.
* Can be used in combination with Steps.
