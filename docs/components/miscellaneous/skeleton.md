> Skeletons are loaders used as placeholders instead of actual content prior to being loaded completely.


## Variants

There are 4 different types of skeletons provided in GEL as MVP.

## Guidance

* Avatars, cards, charts, content blocks, lists, and tables are good candidates for a skeleton state.
* Use rounded corners, even for rectangular shapes. Shapes follow the standard spacing guidelines.
* Each shape should represent content in a recognizable way. For example, a long rectangle for a line of text or a circle for an avatar.
* Instantly loading content doesn't need a skeleton loader.
* A skeleton loader shouldnâ€™t be used in combination with a spinner, choose the one that fits the use case best.


## When to use

* Offer a simplified preview of loading content to help manage user expectations while decreasing perceived load time.
