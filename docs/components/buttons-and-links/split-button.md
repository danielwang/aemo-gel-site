## Guidance

* Secondary split buttons are for actions that are of less value similar to secondary button but with additional actionable items.
* Similar to dropdown buttons, consider using a tiered menu when the user selects or clicks the dropdown icon.

### When to use

* Split buttons are to be used when an action needs to be a default action and other available actions can be organized inside the dropdown button.

### When not to use

* If there is no default action and all the options has the same weightage in priority, consider using a [dropdown](dropdown.md) instead.
