## Guidance

* A tree follows a top-down pattern and each consecutive nested node (level) is indented to communicate the hierarchy.
* In trees with checkboxes, checking the parent node selects the entire node content inside.

## When to use

* Create hiereachical structures to view and access parent and child nodes.
