## Guidance

* Popover should be used in conjunction with the help icon to provide extended information for the target element.
* The informatin provided in a popover is not necessarily critical for the user to act upon.
* Popover is an actionable overlay, therefore requiring user to click the icon to dipslay the popover.
* Popover can be dismissed by either clicking the close icon that comes with the component or when clicking outside.

### When to use

* When you donâ€™t want to lose the context but still would like to provided extended information to the user.
* Should be used to provide short summaries about the target element.

### When not to use

* Use [tooltip](tooltip.md) if its not multiline and requires no extra information.
* Consider using [modal](modal.md) if you are displaying critical information that require action to complete the task.
