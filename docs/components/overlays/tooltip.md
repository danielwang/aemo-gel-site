## Demo

## Guidance

* Tooltip should be as short as possible, ideally a one liner and single line.
* Tooltip should be displayed in hover state.
* Tooltip should be at a gap of spacer-2 with the element.
* Actionable icons/toolbar which does not have a accompanying text should have tooltip added to the icons/toolbar.
* Should remain in place when user moves cursor within the target element.
* Should have a delay of 500ms to help confirm hover intent.
* The text inside a tooltip should always be center aligned.

## When to use

* Use tooltip when an element requires additional information.
